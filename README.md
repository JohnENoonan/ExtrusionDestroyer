### To Setup Script
The easiest way to run the Python script is to dowload extrusionDestroyer.py to either **maya/projects/default/scripts**,  or **maya/*year*/scripts**
### To Run the Script
In Maya open the script editor and click **file/loadScript** and select the correct file. If the folder that extrusionDestroyer.py is in does not immediately appear, you can navigate to it. Once the file is selected, hit the play button in the top right of the script editor window which will create the ExtrusionDestroyer UI window
